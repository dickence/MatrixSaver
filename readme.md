# MatrixSaver

### A completely unoriginal name for a completely unoriginal product

In short: my take on the "digital rain" effect made famous by The Matrix. Heavy lifting handled by [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org). 

The main itch being scratched here is multi-monitor support. Why is it so hard to find good screensavers with good multiple monitor support (and performance)? For fellow developers the main point of interest here would be as an example of SFML.Net in the 'real world'.

## Status

I am in the process of sorting through my repos, culling the ones which have succumbed to disinterest and/or code rot, and migrating the remainder to GitLab.

This sits in limbo between those two states. As of August 2018 I haven't gotten around to fixing some bugs preventing it from working out-of-the-box so it remains on GitHub for now.
